Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to not participate in any competitive events this season for the safety of our players and our community. We will not attend any USAU sanctioned post-season events for the 2020 club season, should they be held. Molly Brown continues as a team and community: our 2020 focus and energy will be dedicated to local organizing, activism, and internal anti-racism work.

We recognize the deep injustices highlighted by the state-sanctioned murders of Elijah McClain, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and countless others at the hands of the police, as well as the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black and brown communities. American white supremacy culture leads to unpunished white supremacist violence conducted by private citizens, such as in the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Robert Forbes, and Trayvon Martin. Neither our community nor our team are immune to white supremacy culture; it is pervasive and insidious in individuals and organizations nationwide.

We will use the time we usually dedicate to practice and team events to facilitate learning experiences and dialogue aimed towards identifying and dismantling white supremacy on our team, in our workplaces, and in our community.

We also recognize that financial resources are needed to continue the current organizing efforts and movement. We have put forth a plan to contribute the amount we would have spent at Pro-Elite Challenge, US Open, Pro Championships, Regionals and Nationals to local organizations. We estimate we would have spent approximately $30,000 on bid fees, player fees, flights, and travel accommodations throughout the 2020 season. By December 1, 2020, we will redistribute at least $30,000 to local Black, Indigenous, Latinx or Asian-American-owned and led organizations.

We invite teams to join us in our redistribution effort. We are happy to share our process as it develops. Please reach out to mollybrownultimate@gmail.com with any questions.

> *This summer, Molly Brown is committed to educating ourselves, as well as opening up spaces for the Colorado community and greater ultimate community for a series of teach-ins. These teach-ins offer a sliding scale contribution, to which the funds go towards compensating the speakers for their time, and additional funds will go to an organization of their choosing.
